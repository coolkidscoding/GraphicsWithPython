    "This is a course about Python in the context of Graphics.  We are going to be reinforcing the concepts we learned in previous semesters, but instead of generating output that is primarily numerical or text based, the output our programs are going to generate this semester is going to be graphical.  We are going to draw every class.  Sounds like something students did in kindergarden, doesn't it?  In this class we are going to draw using Python.\n",

    "As we learned in previous semesters python is a programming language that supports thousands of packages.  There are packages that support random number functionality, there are packages that support audio processing.  As you can probable guess there are packages that support graphical output.  Specifically we are going to be using a package called **turtle**.  With the turtle package we will be able to use turtle statements in our python code to draw and manipulate graphical shapes.  In previous semesters, all our work was done in the Jupyter notebook, in this semester we will only go over the lesson in Jupyter.  All our work will be done in a platform called **Repl.it**.  A repl is a terminal that allows you to **R**ead-**E**valuate-**P**rint-**L**oop.  The reason we have to use a different platform is because turtle is not supported on the Jupyter notebook.\n",

Once you log in you will notice a classroom that is avaialble.  When you enter it you will see the in class and homework assignments.  The direct link to join the classroom is [here](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/erpuPhO).\n",
