# <center>[**Cool Kids Coding School**](http://www.coolkidscodingschool.com)<br>Course Syllabus: **Programming Graphics with Python**<br>  Fall 2019
---
+ **Lesson 1:  Background and Introduction to Development Environment**
  > This course will be an introduction to computer programming using graphics.  We will revisit topics we have already discussed in the context of graphical programming.  The programming language we will use in this course will be python, and the graphical package we use will be turtle. In this class we will review the development environment and the turtle commands that allow us to draw with code.
  
+ **Lesson 2:  Creating shapes (Part1)**
  > Discuss how we will use the turtle commands to create various geometric shapes.  Use variables and operators to create these shapes and then perform various operations on them.
  
+ **Lesson 3: Creating shapes (Part2)**
  > Continue discussion started in previous class on geometric shape creation

+ **Lesson 4: Measuring Shape Attributes (Part1)**
  > Now that we can generate various geometric shapes how do we measure various attributes?

+ **Lesson 5: Measuring Shape Attributes (Part2)**
  > Continue discussion from last class on measuring attributes of various shapes.

+ **Lesson 6:  Shapes in Motion (Part1)**

+ **Lesson 7:  Shapes in Motion (Part2)**

+ **Lesson 8:  Conditions on Shapes (Part1)** 

+ **Lesson 9:  Conditions on Shapes (Part2)**

+ **Lesson 10: Graphics with Functions**

+ **Lesson 11: Review**
  > Review the material we have covered so far in preparation for the final exam.
  
+ **Lesson 12: Final Exam**
