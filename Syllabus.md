# <center>[**Cool Kids Coding School**](http://www.coolkidscodingschool.com)<br>Course Syllabus: **Programming Graphics with Python**<br>  Fall 2019
---
+ **Lesson 1:  Background and Introduction to Development Environment**
  > This course will be an introduction to computer programming using graphics.  We will revisit topics we have already discussed in the context of graphical programming.  The programming language we will use in this course will be python, and the graphical package we use will be turtle. In this class we will review the development environment and the turtle commands that allow us to draw with code.
  
+ **Lesson 2:  Fundamentals of Graphics**
  > In this lesson we will be discussing the following topics:
  + Cartesian coordinate system
  + Introduce namedtuples
  + Representing points
  + Representing line segments
  
+ **Lesson 3: Consolidation Lesson**
  > In this lesson we are going to deep dive the homework and review everything we have learned so far inorder to get a firm understanding of where we are in the curriculum.

+ **Lesson 4: Quiz**
  > We are going to start this lesson with a 20 minute paper quiz to ensure students have the required grasp of the material.  After we review the quiz we will jump into the lesson.

+ **Lesson 5: Rendering Geometric Shapes**
    > In this lesson we are going to start a project that will allow draw a cartesian coordinate grid on the screen.  Once done with that we are going to take the definitions of the basic graphic constructs that we just learned and extend that to turn it into a graphing program.  We will create data structures that we can use to represent shapes and and we will create functions that we will use to actually graph these constructs.

+ **Lesson 6: Geometric Manipulation of Shapes**
  > In this class we will learn the basic manipulations of a graphical object.  We will learn:
  + translation
  + rotation
  + reflection
  + scaling
  + shear

+ **Lesson 7: Linear Equations**
  > In this lesson we will learn how to graph linear equations.  We will learn what a linear equation is and how to represent it.

+ **Lesson 8:  TBD**

+ **Lesson 9:  TBD** 

+ **Lesson 10:  TBD**

+ **Lesson 11: Review**
  > Review the material we have covered so far in preparation for the final exam.
  
+ **Lesson 12: Final Exam**
  > A short exam to reinforce the material we have learned in this course.
